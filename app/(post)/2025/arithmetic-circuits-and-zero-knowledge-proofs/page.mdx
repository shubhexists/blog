Hi, these are my notes while deep diving into zero knowledge proofs.

## Terminologies
- PSPACE Problems - Problems that require exponential resources to solve and verify.
- P Problems - Problem should be both solveable and verifyable in polynomial time.
- NP Problem - Problem should be verifyable in polynomial time but might take exponential time to solve.

To verify every problem, we must be able to put that problem in form of a boolean expression (formula).
These boolean circuits use logic gates (AND, OR, NOT etc).
Having a possible solution that makes the equation `true` means that problem is true.

### How it relates to ZK Proof?
ZK Proofs only work with NP and P type of problems. i.e. the ones that are easily verifyable.
We assume that the user knows the problem to the boolean problem that only he can solve.
We verify it as NP or P problems are easily verifyable.

Without efficient verification, creating a zero knowledge proof for a problem becomes infeasible.

## Arithmetic Circuits
Binary Circuits are usually very long even for very small problems and hence we usually use Arithmetic Circuits
to represent Zero Knowledge proofs.

An arithmetic circuit is a system of equations using only addition, multiplication, and equality. (NOTHING ELSE)
Variables in an arithmetic circuit are referred to as `signals`.

Example - 

```
6 = x₁ + x₂
9 = x₁x₂
```
This is not a equation that we need to solve. User who needs to provide us the solution would give us the answers
to prove that he knows something and we would just need to verify it by putting values.

Many ZK Algorithms like SNARK, STARK and Bulletproof rely on these arithmetic circuits.
These circuits naturally translate into a Rank-1 Constraint System (R1CS) which is a standard representation in Zero Knowledge Proofs.

The prover can assign arbitary values to the curcuit's signals, but the proof is only valid only if these values satify the condition.
